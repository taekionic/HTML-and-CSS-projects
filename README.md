# HTML-and-CSS-projects
This contains my HTML and CSS projects developed during the learning process.

It will include all projects developed during the HTML and CSS course at The Tech Academy (learncodinganywhere.com), as well as any passion projects I decide to work on during this period.

Projects:

Space Station site
---

This project involved me learning to integrate various CSS elements into my HTML. During this project, I developed an understanding of, and the ability to manipulate various aspects
of a webpage, including containers, meta-elements, bootstrap, etc. The end product was a website for a "space resort" agency, which would allow users to view pictures, information, 
and form elements to allow visitors to submit reservation requests.

My Own Website
---
This project really allowed me to practice and absorb a wide range of CSS functinality. In an effort to develop a deeper understanding, many hours were spent externally 
learning on the workings of webkit tools, animation functions (including hovers, transitions, etc). The final website served as a sort of 'test' portfolio. As I learn more and more
about coding, I will be incorporating javascript elements to this, as well as enhancing interactiveness and functionality.

Movie theatre website

This website project introduced me to various bootstrap functions. HTML and CSS can be complicated, and the more features you'd like on a page, the more complicated it can be.
Here, I learned about how bootstrap can aid immensely in creating a functional website, providing the framework for many possible modifications you may want on your website. 
For example, buttons, grid structures, form elements, etc. - all of which were incorporated into the end project.

Portfolio site

This project saw me making a portfolio website and practicing all the things I had learned above. My understanding of background videos and images was enhanced here, although
the larger purpose was to allow me to fully put into practice what I had learned during the HTML And CSS course.

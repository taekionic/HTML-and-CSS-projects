unvisited links are blue, visited are purple, and actiive are red.
anchor element needs an antribute called href attribute. short for hypertext reference.
for example <a href="">check out this link</a> would display link with text check out this link

code should be organized by file and folder. code directory should contain code/html, code/style,
code/java, etc.

href attributes come in two types - explicit and implicit. implicit are used to create 
link to another webpage that is located in same folder as the page the <a> tag is in. 
Explicit links to files not contained in folder, typically external websites/links.

<nav> tag defines set of navigation links. Typically included on nav bars (rectangular strip
that include links to the main pages of a website)

ajax - asyncronous javascript and xml. Set of tools that can be used to create asyncronous functions
normal webpages require user to issue a 'request' to the server to see a specific page. 
Server then gathers necessary files and sends them over as a 'response'
if creator wants to make it so content can change dynamically, or based on user action, they
can utilie ajax. instead of requesting entire webpage be recreated, creator can just make the 
new content is all that is requested from server. Way it works is that user creates an
'asyncronous 'request'' for just a specific section of the webpage.

xhr stands for xml http request
xhr is a set of apis that can be used by scripting languages. it is used to transfer xml, etc data to and from
web server using http. xhr works by making a communication path between client side and server side. 

<script> is used to define javascript script. object is something w state and behavior. method
is something an object can do. alert is a javascript method that displays an alert box w ok button.
